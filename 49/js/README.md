# Group Anagrams (JavaScript Solution)

This directory contains the JavaScript solution for the LeetCode problem 49: Group Anagrams.

## Requirements

To run the test script, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

No external dependencies are required, as the tests use Node.js's built-in `assert` module.

## How to Run Tests

Navigate to this directory (`49/js`) in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
node test_49.js
```

If all tests pass, you will see the following output:

```
All test cases passed!
```

If a test fails, an `AssertionError` will be thrown, indicating which test case did not produce the expected result.
